# PPM Photo editor
The primary objective of this project is to create an intuitive and efficient photo editor that can perform essential image editing functions such as cropping, color adjustments, and filters. This project will also serve as a foundational learning tool for understanding image processing algorithms and developing skills in software development, particularly in handling graphical data.

## Realeasse 1.0
The following features will be available with the first realease. 

### Filters
1. Gaussian Blur: (work in progress).
2. Colour adjustments: (planned).

### Processing
1. Edge Detection: (planned).

### Editing  
1. Dimension editing: (planned).

## Sources
A big part of the math applied in the processing of the images loaded is based on the lectures of the Foundamental Course on Computer Vision of the Columbia University (https://fpcv.cs.columbia.edu/Monographs).
